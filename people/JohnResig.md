[John Resig](http://ejohn.org/about/) is the initial author of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and the Dean of Computer Science at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). Resig developed [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) (a JavaScript port of Processing) to enable better implementation of visualization and animation of Processing in 2010. Written in JavaScript, Processing.js converts Processing codes written in Java, and uses HTML5’s <canvas> element to render images. The idea of translating Java to JavaScript suggests a wonderful adaptation strategy to the changing programming environment. (Here is [a praise](https://www.reddit.com/comments/6ipvz/processingjs_john_resigs_javascript) among the developpers on Reddit.) Owning to Resig’s work, Processing users do not need to abandon Processing (which operates in now-close-to-obsolete-Java). All Processing users need to do is to include Resig’s JavaScript file “processing-1.0.0.min.js” to their .pde file, just as they have always done.
