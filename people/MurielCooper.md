Muriel Cooper is [the founder of the MIT's Visual Language Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn9zCrIJzLs). The workshop is now known as the [MIT Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu/). Since 1973, Cooper directed the Visual Language Workshop until her death in 1994. Processing gives credits to many of its foundational ideas to the Workshop.

In addition to her work as a graphic designer at the MIT press, the Visual Language Workshop produced gifted software designers including information architect Lisa Strausfeld and the former president of the Rhode Island School of Design, John Maeda (who taught Ben Fry and Casey Reas). Cooper herself can be regarded as a pioneer of graphic designer and educator who envisioned “the content, quality and technology of communication [to] inform each other in education, professional and research programs” as she notes in [her 1980 letter](http://www.dextersinister.org/MEDIA/PDF/Thisstandsasasketchforthefuture.pdf).
