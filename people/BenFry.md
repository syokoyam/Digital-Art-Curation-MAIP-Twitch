Ben Fry is a principal of design and software consultancy [Fathom] (https://fathom.info/). Having received a doctoral program from the Aesthetics + Computation Group at the MIT Media Laboratory, Fry has been recognized for his data visualization work. Together with Caset Reas, Fry developped a programming language called [Processing] (https://processing.org/) in 2011 while they were still graduate students at the MIT. Supported by a vibrant developping community, Processing's integrated development environment (IDE) is in its third iteration. Fry is the author of O'Reilly's *Visualizing Data* (2007), co-author, with Reas, of *Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists* (O'reilly, 2010) and *Getting Started with Processing* (O'Reilly, 2010).
