[Casey Reas](http://reas.com/information) is a software artist who “writes software to explore conditional systems of art.” Trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Media Arts and Sciences, Reas utilizes the generative software to produce dynamic graphics. 

While being a graduate student at the MIT, Reas and his colleague Ben Fry invented a programming language called [Processing](https://processing.org/). In a 2008 [interview](http://adage.com/article/feature/digital-talent-ben-fry-casey-reas/125765/), Reas states the motivation behind their invention as follows:

>It’s not very common for artists and designers to be the primary authors of programming environment, but this is changing. I hope Processing has helped to demonstrate that we don’t need to rely only on what software companies market to us and what engineers think we need. As a creative community, we can create our own tools for our specific needs and desires.

Encouraged by such an Open Souce policy, the developing community developed 70+ libraries of Processing within seven years after the release. Processing users’ fields include: 12K and higher education, music industry, journal publishing, design and art industries. As a result, the language initially developed to teach computational graphic design literacy can now process audio, electronics, and animation. 

Development of [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)--a JavaScript port of Processing--by John Resig in 2010, is among the many community efforts to keep Processing prevalent. Reas published [Twitch](http://reas.com/twitch/)--a series of minimal one button game--in 2009, leveraging the elementally interactive features Processing.js enables. Twitch is also a part of Google Chrome Experiements projects.
