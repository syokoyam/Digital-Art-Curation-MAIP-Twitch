In order to allow users an interaction with Twitch, the source files need to be generated on a web browser. Web browsers need to support [HTLM5 <canvas> element](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp). As of April 2016, browsers that qualify such requirements are: Chrome 4.0, Internet Explorer 9.0, FireFox 2.0, Safari 3.1, and Opera 9.0.
